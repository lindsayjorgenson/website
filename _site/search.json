Programming in R is my favorite thing (aside from my lovely children, husband, and hoofed friends). I also like chess, puzzles, and Avatar the Last Airbender.\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n        Education\n        Skills\n        Experience\n        Talks\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  Degrees\n   \n  2008 – 2011 \n  University of Kansas \n  BA, Psychology + Art   \n  \n  2012 – 2015 \n  Washington Univ. in St. Louis \n  Master of Public Health   \n  \n  2012 – 2015 \n  Washington Univ. in St. Louis \n  Master of Social Work  \n  \n  \n  Relevant Training\n   \n  Data Science with R   \n  Programming and Applied Statistics in R   \n  Programming in R   \n  R Best Practices   \n  Machine Learning with TidyModels   \n  Reporting with Quarto   \n  An Introduction to SQL with R   \n  Package Development   \n  Version Control Using Git & GitHub      \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Programming\n                Data Viz & UX\n                Research & Data Sci\n                Leadership\n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n  \n\n  \n   Current Position  \n  I oversee ASTHO’s business intelligence planning and products (dashboards, data visualizations, data storytelling) and support the organization's use of data to inform\n  decision making. One of my team’s flagship products is the Profile dashboard, which has received recognition for its modern design and useability. In addition to\n  supporting ASTHO’s internal business intelligence needs, my team provides data services to partner organizations in dashboarding and data visualization. I am ASTHO's\n  subject matter expert in R programming, interactive data visualization and data storytelling, and custom dashboard development. \n  \n\n  \n  Tailoring Shiny for Modern Users \n  ShinyConf 2024  \n  My talk at ShinyConf was attended by ~400 participants and focused on UI and UX in shiny app development. My slides are available here. After the presentation, my work was featured on Eric Nantz's podcast, R Weekly Highlights. Check it out starting around 19:30.",
